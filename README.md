The Antimony extension adds language support for Antimony to Visual Studio Code for building models in Systems Biology.

The currently available version 0.2 is a public beta version developed by [Longxuan Fan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/longxf), [Sai Anish Konanki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anish-konanki-8b81a575/), [Eva Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evaliu02), [Steve Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-ma/), [Gary Geng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-geng-9995a2160/), [Dr. Joseph Hellerstein](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/joseph-hellerstein/home?authuser=0), and [Dr. Herbert Sauro](https://bioe.uw.edu/portfolio-items/sauro/) at the University of Washington. Dr. Joseph Hellerstein is responsible for future releases, and please feel free to [contact](mailto:joseph.hellerstein@gmail.com) him if you have any questions.

Please note that the current release does not support the complete Antimony grammar. While most grammar has been supported, more will be included in future releases.

## Installation
The Antimony extension pack includes two extensions: [Antimony](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevem.vscode-antimony) and [Antimony Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevem.vscode-antimony-syntax) for the color scheme. The [Antimony Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevem.antimony-extension-pack) is also available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. We recommend installing the extension pack directly so you have full access to all of the features. For installation, simply download the extension pack from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace and install.

## Features
The extension provides many convenient features for developing biological models with the Antimony language in tellurium. The current release focuses on the areas below.

### 1. Syntax recognition and highlights

<em>(Syntax Highlights)</em>
</p>

⚠️ Note: the default syntax highlighting for Antimony is provided by a separate extension [Antimony Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevem.vscode-antimony-syntax), and is also available in the [Antimony Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevem.antimony-extension-pack) 

### 2. Automatic annotation creation with database recommendation
The extension can recognize different types of variables, and recommend databases base on the [OMEX metadata specification](https://doi.org/10.1515/jib-2021-0020).

### 3. Hover messages

### 5. Error detection
The extension supports various warning and error detections to help modelers debug their model during development. Our design principle for whether an issue should be a warning or an error entirely depends on the logic of tellurium. Our extension will mark the subject as an error if tellurium throws an error while rendering the model, with a red underline. An example would be calling a function that does not exist (usually due to a typo, which is extremely common during development. Read more in my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FutuOYgq9Jd_AHqp_z4f2joDavVIURuz/view?usp=sharing)).

<em>(Typos are extremely common in software development)</em>
</p>

On the other hand, certain issues are not errors in tellurium, but we thought it would be worthwhile to have the user's attention. For example, missing initial values for species and overriding a previously defined value.

The extension supports a wide range of errors and warnings, and we plan to support more in the upcoming releases. Read more in [issues](https://github.com/sys-bio/vscode-antimony/issues).

## Known Issues
I have an open issue for [manually curating models](https://github.com/sys-bio/vscode-antimony/issues/26) from BioModels to test the extension. Please feel free to contribute and submit issues.
* subvariables in modular models are currently not supported and false error messages will be triggered.
