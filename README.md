The Antimony extension adds language support for Antimony to Visual Studio Code for building models in Systems Biology.

The currently available version 0.1 is a public beta version developed by [Gary Geng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-geng-9995a2160/), [Steve Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-ma/), and Dr. [Joseph Hellerstein](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/joseph-hellerstein/home?authuser=0) at the University of Washington. Steve Ma is responsible for future releases, and please feel free to [contact](mailto:bochenma@cs.washington.edu) him if you have any questions.

Please note that the current release does not support the complete Antimony grammar. While most grammar has been supported, more will be included in future releases.
